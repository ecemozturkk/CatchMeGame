# Catch Me Game ðŸ‘¾

CatchMeGame is a fun iOS game that challenges players to catch as many moving characters as possible within a time limit. When the project is first opened, the characters from Rick and Morty appear and start to disappear, and your goal is to touch the characters before the time runs out. When you touch a character, your score increases, and if you surpass the high score, the high score becomes your score. The high score data is stored using UserDefaults. When the time is up, an alert pops up and you can choose to play again if you wish.
